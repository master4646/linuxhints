The recommended permissions for /home/username/.ssh are read/write/execute for the user, and must not be accessible by group and others.

# chmod u+rwx,go-rwx ~/.ssh
# chmod  0700 ~/.ssh

If ssh complains of wrong permissions on any of the above files, you can set the correct permissions for any of the files like this.

# chmod u+rw,go-rwx .ssh/id_rsa
# chmod u+rw,go-rwx .ssh/id_rsa.pub
# chmod u+rw,go-rwx .ssh/authorized_keys
# chmod u+rw,go-rwx .ssh/known_hosts
# chmod u+rw,go-rwx .ssh/config
OR
# chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa
# chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa.pub
# chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
# chmod 600 .ssh/known_hosts
# chmod 600 .ssh/config
